TEST REPO
I HAVE MOVED TO ssv2, customized all strings fucntions used in all functions , updated header renamed and added another file for string functions, reintegrated strtok since it showed no error in the first place, in all all function are customized (exception of getenv) 
fixed all betty documentation and style
please pull before submitting any changes

Update:
betty, memory leaks, fix getline = done     
0/1/2/3/4/5/6/8/15 = done   
TASK 7 (fix strtok) + TASK 9 (setenv + unsetenv) + TASK 10 (_getenv + setenv) = in progress     

--------------------------------
the code is working with no errors and no memory leaks for all tasks from 0 to 8 + 15
i'm working on 9 , the functions will integrated in built in , hope they will be ready by tonight
i will move all files to root of repository so that they can serve as back up, you never know, meanwhile we keep working on ss version
i will update betty documentation later for the new functions.
